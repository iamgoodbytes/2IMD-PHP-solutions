## Tip 1: import spotify_faker_data.sql
☑ The .sql file contains all data you need for this lab. Just import it through phpmyadmin or your favourite mysql client.

## Tip 2: work in levels
Split your work in levels. Possible levels are:
- ☑ looping over and printing playlists
- ☑ looping over and printing artists
- linking an artist to the artist.php page by using a $_GET parameter
- printing artist details in artist.php
- ☑ building the user registration in register.php (use bcrypt!)
- ☑ building the user login in login.php
